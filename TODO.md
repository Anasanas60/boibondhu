### 2. Security Audit
- Review authentication flow and password handling
- Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities in PHP files
- Assess XSS risks in React components
- Evaluate file upload security
- Review CORS configuration
- Check for exposed credentials

### 3. UX/UI Assessment
- Evaluate navigation and user flow
- Review form validation and feedback
- Check loading states and responsiveness
- Assess accessibility features
- Review visual hierarchy and design consistency

### 4. Backend & Database Audit

## Dependent Files to Review
- All src/ files for frontend analysis
- All api/ files for backend analysis
- Configuration files (vite.config.js, package.json, eslint.config.js)
- Database schema files (init_db.sql, migrate files)

## Followup Steps
- Run the application to test functionality
- Use browser tools to analyze performance metrics
- Check console for errors during usage
- Test security vulnerabilities manually
- Verify responsive design across devices

## Completed Features
